# Introduction

### Project Goals:

The objective of my Ph.D. will be to take a compuational and biochemical approach to investigate the role of Transcription Factor RNA interactions. 

### Reposistory Description: 
This repository will collect the computational methods, scripts, and analyses used in my project: maintining the goal of rigor and reproducibility. It will contain the scripts used on how to generate figures from my data, and document my compuational work.

Additionally, as I move forrward in my Ph.D. and beyond, this will be a place where I complile my computational skills for historical puprposes and acceible access to knowledge that I have currated.
